# XPortAIO
All-In-One cross (X) platform ported modules for [Oasys](https://oasys.zone/).

# What is a port?
In the context of coding, a "port" often refers to the process of taking a piece of software that was written for one operating system or environment and adapting it to run on a different operating system or environment. This is known as "porting" the software. 
Now, In the context of XPortAIO, a "port" refers to addons or scripts from other script providers that have been transpiled for compatibility with [Oasys](https://oasys.zone/).

# Does it support all champions?
Yes, it will be. However, at the moment, only a select number of champions are supported due to the time constraints associated with this project.

# What to expect from XPortAIO in the upcoming future
Expect to see favourite scripts from previous platforms such as LeagueSharp or EloBuddy making a comeback, along with others. At present, I'm planning to revive series like SharpShooter, MarksmanAIO Kurisu's series, and KoreanAIO, among others. I also hope to reintroduce Sebby's OKTW in the future. Expect to see utility scripts too, including but not limited to BaseUlt, EvadeSharp/EvadePlus/EzEvade, and Activators.
